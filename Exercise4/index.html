            One day a frog left the pond of the village and hopped to a lake in a nearby forest.<br />
            He went to the forest to make his new home there. When he reached there he did not see anyone around.<br />
            He wanted to meet everyone and make new friends. So the frog climbed a high rock by the lake and said,<br />
            "Friends, please come here.I am new here. I want to meet all of you. I have come from the village.<br />
            "Many animals heard his voice and came to the lake. The deer, the tortoise, the duck, the rabbit,<br />
            the birds, the squirrel, the butterfly and the fox came there.The frog said, "Let me introduce myself.<br />
            I am Dr. Croaky. I am a doctor who can cure any ailment that you might be suffering from.<br />
            I have medicines for all animals’ diseases. You can come to meet me anytime."Hearing this, the fox said,<br />
            "If you can cure everyone then why haven't you cured your lame legs?See how you keep hopping around all the time."<br />
            All the animals and birds laughed at the frog. The frog went red with shame for his lie had been detected.<br />
